Emotions are an inevitable portion of any interpersonal communication. They can be expressed in many different forms which may or may not be observed with the naked eye. Therefore, with the right tools, any indications preceding or following them can be subject to detection and recognition. There has been an increase in the need to detect a personâ€™s emotions in the past few years. There has been interest in human emotion recognition in various fields including, but not limited to, human-computer interface, animation, healthcare, and security.Emotion recognition can be performed using different features, such as face, speech and even text. Among these features, facial expressions are one of the most popular, if not the most popular, due to a number of reasons; they are visible, they contain many useful features for emotion recognition, and it is easier to collect a large dataset of faces (than other means for human recognition).Recently, with the use of deep learning and especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), many features can be extracted and learned for a decent facial expression recognition system.
